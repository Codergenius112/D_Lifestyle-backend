/**
 * Resolves the caller's business context once per request and attaches it
 * for downstream controllers/services to use:
 *
 *   request.businessIds      — string[] | undefined (undefined = super admin)
 *   request.activeBusinessId — string | null
 *
 * activeBusinessId is used for WRITES that need exactly one business
 * target (e.g. "which business does this new walk-in booking belong to").
 * It's resolved as:
 *   - the "x-business-id" header, if the caller sent one (must be in their
 *     accessible set, otherwise 403);
 *   - otherwise, the caller's sole accessible business, if they only have one;
 *   - otherwise null (ambiguous — the caller must send the header).
 * Super admin may pass any businessId via the header, or omit it entirely
 * for cross-business actions.
 *
 * This guard does NOT reject requests for having no accessible businesses —
 * that's a legitimate state (e.g. a brand-new owner with none approved
 * yet) and is left to individual controllers/services to handle (usually
 * by returning empty results, per the existing convention in this codebase).
